# Convolutional-Neural-Net-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

In this Python based Application we allow a user to draw any digit using his mouse in canvas (provided screen). Later using Convolutional Neural Network we predict which digit the user must have drawn. In this application we have already stored the optimum weight values for the neural network.

Libraries Used:
1)numpy
2)Matplotlib
3)Keras
4)Scipy
5)PIL
6)Tinker
7)Image
8)ImageDraw
